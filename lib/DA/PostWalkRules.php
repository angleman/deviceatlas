/**
 * This class is used by the main Api class and should not be used directly.
 * 
 * This class tries to extract properties from the User-Agent string itself. This is
 * a completely separate step to the main JSON tree walk but uses the results of the
 * tree walk to optimise the property extraction. The property extraction is done in
 * two steps.
 *
 * Step 1: Try and identify the type of User-Agent and thus the set of property
 * extraction rules to run. This is optimised by the properties from the tree walk.
 *
 * Step 2: Run the rules found in step 1 to try and extract the properties.
